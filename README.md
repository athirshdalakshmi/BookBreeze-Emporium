This project introduces the technologies used in the building of an online bookshop website and describes the functional structure of the system using a function diagram. The front-end system handles user login and registration, commodity display, shopping cart management, and other module operations. The backend manages users, keeps track of book sales history, adds and manages books, handles orders, and performs other module activities. Through application of the Online-bookstores website, users can buy books online, which solves the problem that users are busy and have no time to shop in physical bookstores
